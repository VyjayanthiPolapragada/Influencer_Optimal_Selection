    "\n",
    "The objective value (7.26 million) and the bound (7.26 million) are the same, indicating that the optimization process has found an optimal solution with no gap between the best possible outcome and the current solution. \n",
    "This means that the model has successfully reached an optimal solution.\n",

    "- The model chose 5 influencers: Cristiano Ronaldo, Kylie Jenner, Kendall Jenner, Neymarjr, and Zendaya.\n",
    "- Time allocation and cost for each influencer vary (e.g., Cristiano Ronaldo was allocated 1.27 hours, while others were given 1 hour each).\n",
    "- Budget constraint is satisfied (the total cost is exactly 90,000$)\n",
    "- Minimum followers constraint is satisfied for each selected influencer (>100M followers).\n",

    "#### **Interpretation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The results from the Branch and Bound and Branch and Cut methods are identical in terms of the optimal solution \n",
    "(Engagement Score: 7.26 million, Total Cost: $90,000 and Time Allocation for each influencer), there are some key differences in the optimization processes and the outputs that can be highlighted:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Differences** :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Model Structure and Size:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Branch and Bound:** The model had 443 rows, 301 columns, and 1292 nonzeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Branch and Cut:** The model had 444 rows, 301 columns, and 1430 nonzeros. This slight difference in the number of rows and nonzeros could indicate some differences in how the models were formulated or processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Heuristic Solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Branch and Bound:** Two heuristic solutions were found during the optimization process with objective values of 1,041,176.41 and 5,130,179.62, which is part of the search for an optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Branch and Cut:** One heuristic solution was found with an objective value of 1,444,702.41. This indicates a difference in the heuristic solutions found, though these are just initial solutions and do not affect the final optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Presolve Time and Matrix Statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Branch and Bound:** The presolve time was 0.01 seconds, and the matrix had large coefficients. The model was simplified to 85 rows, 80 columns, and 316 nonzeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Branch and Cut:** The presolve time was 0.00 seconds, and the matrix also had large coefficients, but it was simplified to 59 rows, 54 columns, and 238 nonzeros. The difference in the number of rows and columns after presolve suggests that the Branch and Cut method might have been more aggressive in removing redundant constraints or variables during the presolve phase."

    "#### **Interpretation of the Result:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The output from the Genetic Algorithm (GA) provides an optimal solution with the following key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Optimal Solution Found:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Total Engagement Score of 7.26 million and Total Cost of $78,865.96 were achieved, with a Total Time Allocation of 5 hours. The engagement score and selected influencers are similar to the optimal solution obtained from other methods like Branch and Bound and Branch and Cut, but the cost is slightly lower in this case, suggesting that the Genetic Algorithm was able to allocate time and budget more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Genetic Algorithm Evolution:\n",
    " \n",
    "The GA was run for 500 generations, which means it evolved and iterated over many possible solutions, refining the selection of influencers each time. This gradual improvement allowed the algorithm to converge on an optimal set of influencers and their time allocations while satisfying all the constraints (budget, time, diversity, and minimum followers).\n",
    "\n",
    "The tournament selection and crossover processes helped maintain a diverse set of solutions, and mutation ensured that the population did not converge prematurely on suboptimal solutions. Over the generations, the population evolved towards the optimal influencer selection, balancing the engagement score and cost effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Further Improvement:**\n",

    "\n",
    "By allocating more time to the influencer with higher influence_score, we achieved the same result as the previous methods. However, we can still see that the total available time (6 hours) was not utilized completely as the primary goal was to satisfy the budget constraint and to increase the time based on the influencer's score. \n",

    "#### **Interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The total Engagement Score remains the same at 7.26million which indicates that the selected influencers continue to generate the same level of engagement. This is crucial because the goal is to maximize the engagement score given a fixed budget and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Total Time is now 6.0 hours, which perfectly matches the available time to allocate to influencers. This shows that the time allocation has been optimized to fully utilize the available 6 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Additional Budget Required is 16,190.84, meaning that the original budget of 90,000 is not sufficient to cover the increased costs of allocating time to these influencers. The adjusted allocation requires an extra 16,190.84 to maintain the engagement levels and utilize the available time effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result shows that while the time is fully utilized, it requires a slightly higher financial commitment to achieve this optimal allocation. However, this could give an estimation of extra costs, if the company decides to utilize all the available time. "

    "### **Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Genetic Algorithm offers a robust approach for solving complex optimization problems, there were several drawbacks in its implementation for the influencer selection and time allocation task. These drawbacks included longer execution times, the need for additional logic to handle time allocation, inefficient use of available time, and variability in results across executions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The algorithm took longer to produce the output (more than 10 seconds in every case). This can be attributed to the nature of genetic algorithms, which involve iterative processes and population evaluations, making them computationally expensive, especially for larger datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. After selecting the best solution (the optimal set of influencers), additional logic was needed to handle the time allocation efficiently. This required manual adjustments or more complex logic to ensure that time was distributed properly across influencers, which added to the complexity of the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Despite selecting the best influencers, the algorithm couldn't completely allocate the available 6 hours. In your case, only 5.5 hours were utilized. This indicates that the genetic algorithm did not optimize the time allocation as effectively as possible, potentially leaving unused time, which could have been spent on additional influencers.\n",

    "4. If the time allocated is adjusted to utilize the available time, we can observe an increase in the budget. However, this can be used to estimate the additional costs incurred if the influencers have to utilized for the entire time.\n",

    "5. The results were different for each execution, which is a common issue with genetic algorithms due to their random nature. The algorithm’s performance can vary because it relies on random initialization and stochastic processes (such as crossover and mutation), leading to different results with each run. The solution obtained may not be the optimal soluton for every execution. "
